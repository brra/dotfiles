#!/usr/bin/env bash

# ~/.bashrc: executed by bash(1) for non-login shells.
# see /usr/share/doc/bash/examples/startup-files (in the package bash-doc)
# for examples

# this file gets run in two cases:
# 1. non-login interactive shell
# 2. remote shell (over ssh or similar)

# #2 happens when you run "ssh user@host bash" explicitly.
# in this case, /etc/bash.bashrc has not been previous executed (unlike #1).
# however, we assume that #2 is a recovery mode, so we don't want to do much.
